        This node receives messages with topics representing gadget names and their associated electric consumption values as payloads. 
        When a message with the topic <code>max_load_capacity</code> is received, the node calculates which gadgets can be turned on without exceeding the provided maximum capacity. 
        The resulting payload will contain an array of gadget names that can be turned on within the max capacity.
    </p>
